# Google Colab

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Krisztiaan/koki2/blob/main/colab/koki2_colab.ipynb)

Use `colab/koki2_colab.ipynb` to bootstrap this repo on Colab (CPU/GPU/TPU) and run a small smoke test.

Tip: to avoid committing execution outputs/metadata back into the repo, use **File → Save a copy in Drive** when running in Colab.

The notebook also includes an optional Stage 1 multi-seed ES + held-out evaluation cell that mirrors the commands in `WORK.md`.
