## 2025-12-16 — Checkpoint: stage1_l10_grid

Checkpoint created:
- Archived the previous plan + lab notebook to `PLAN_stage1_l10_grid.md` and `WORK_stage1_l10_grid.md`.
- This checkpoint includes the Stage 1 L1.0 “effect-size grid” protocol + Colab notebooks and the latest local results (see `WORK_stage1_l10_grid.md` for commands and log paths).

Next:
- Proceed to Stage 2 plasticity comparisons on L1.0 + L1.1, using the protocol defined in `PLAN.md`.
- First action: pre-register the Stage 2 run matrix and budgets here before running.
